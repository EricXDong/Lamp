# Lamp

A little pet project inspired by OS X Spotlight and Alfred, Lamp parses directories specified by the user and stores their executables.

Press Shift+Ctrl+Spacebar to open the Lamp search window and enter the program you want to run.
Lamp will run the program if it finds it in its database.

There is much work to do!
